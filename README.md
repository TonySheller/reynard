# reynard

## Overview 
Reynard is a project that utilizes an agent or agents to reason over cryptograms. The purpose of this project is to delve into artificial intelligence and how reasoning can be used to solve this type of problem.  This specifically focuses on reasoning.  Natural language processing may be involved in the solution as well.  The intent is to learn more about reasoning in AI by working on an interesting project.

More specifically, Bayesian Networks, decision graphs, Monte Carlo tree search, natural language processing are types of AI that will be explored and used.
