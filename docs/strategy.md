## The Strategy

After some initial work, its apparent that many strategies are needed to solve a cryptogram.  The following is the general approach used. 

## First Steps
1. If there are one letter words, then A or I or both.
2. If using a one letter word did a two letter word that begins with A or I become revealed?
3. Are there other two letter words that can be used?  Try as many as possible.
4. Are there three letter words that occur more than once.  The most common three letter word is of course, `the` (in English at least.) `And` is the second most common. 
6. Apply other strategies: such as pattern words like *THAT* (it begins and ends with the same letter), or double letters like LL or RR. This was not implemented.
