## The Strategy

After some initial work, its apparent that many strategies are needed to solve a cryptogram.  Some of these will be detailed here. 

## First Steps
1. If there are one letter words, then A or I or both.
2. If using a one letter word did a a two letter word that begins with A or I become revealed?
3. Are there four letter words that start and end with the same letter, 'a pattern word. `That` is the most common four letter word.
4. Are there three letter words that occur more than once.  The most common three letter word is of course, `the` (in English at least.) `And` is the second most common. 
5. Begin to apply freqeuncy analysis to the puzzle. 
Start with these first steps and form a strategy first.  How will the agent attack the puzzle.  These are the most important first decisions.
