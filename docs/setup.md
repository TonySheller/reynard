# Setup

## Python virtual development environment
First setup a Python virtual environment. Using virtual environments lets one install modules and  even different versions of Python with orinary user privledges.

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) is the Python environment used for this project. This is not necessary, however Anaconda does make it very easy to start over with a new version of Python or a new set of modules if necessary. Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) provided by Anaconda.

## Create the Reynard virtual environment

```
conda create --name reynard --file requirements.txt
```
